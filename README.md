## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- Browsers: Chrome and Firefox (latest versions)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/IdenTiclla/cypress-ecommerce-web-testing-framework
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd cypress-ecommerce-web-testing-framework
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

Make sure to set up any required environment variables in a `.env` file or directly in your execution environment.

Example `.env` file:
```sh
CYPRESS_email=your-email
CYPRESS_password=your-password
```

The main Cypress configuration is in `cypress.config.js`, which defines:
- Base URL: https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io/
- Spec patterns for traditional and Cucumber tests
- Preprocessor and plugin configurations

## Running Tests

To run tests in interactive mode (Cypress GUI):
```sh
npm run test:open
```
Use the GUI to browse through your different tests and select which one to run.

To run all tests in headless mode:
```sh
npm run test
```

To run tests with visible browser interface:
```sh
npm run test:headed
```

To run tests in specific browsers:
```sh
npm run test:chrome
npm run test:firefox
```

To run a specific test:
```sh
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js"
```

## Testing Strategy

This framework implements a comprehensive testing approach that combines multiple testing methodologies:

### 1. End-to-End Testing
- Complete user journey validation
- Real browser interaction simulation
- Cross-browser compatibility verification
- Performance metrics collection

### 2. BDD with Cucumber
- Business-readable Gherkin scenarios
- Stakeholder-friendly test documentation
- Feature-focused test organization
- Clear acceptance criteria definition

### 3. Component Testing
- Isolated UI component testing
- Reusable test fixtures
- Stub/Mock implementation
- State management validation

### 4. API Testing
- Request/Response validation
- Error scenario coverage
- Authentication flow testing
- Data integrity verification

## Continuous Integration

The project leverages Jenkins for robust CI/CD implementation:

### Pipeline Features
- Automated test execution on commits
- Parallel test execution for faster feedback
- Multi-environment test deployment
- Comprehensive test reporting
- Failure notification system
- Test artifact archival

### Quality Gates
- Code linting and style checks
- Test coverage requirements
- Performance benchmarks
- Security scanning integration

## Test Organization

The tests in this project are organized using best practices:

### Directory Structure

- `cypress/e2e/Tests/` - Contains all test files organized by feature
  - `account/` - Tests related to user account functionality
  - `login/` - Tests for login functionality
  - `article/` - Tests for blog article functionality
  - `shopping-cart/` - Tests for shopping cart and checkout functionality
  - `api/` - Tests for API functionality

### Test File Naming

Files are named according to the feature they test, using the `.cy.js` extension.
Example: `login.cy.js`, `register.cy.js`, `shopping-cart.cy.js`

### Page Object Model

The project uses the Page Object Model pattern to organize test code:
- `cypress/e2e/pages/` - Contains page objects for different pages
- `cypress/e2e/components/` - Contains component objects for reusable UI components

This separation helps maintain clean, readable, and maintainable tests.

### Best Practices

1. Each test file focuses on a specific feature or functionality
2. Tests are independent and can run in isolation
3. Common setup is placed in `beforeEach()` hooks
4. Cleanup is performed in `afterEach()` hooks
5. Page objects are used to abstract element selectors and common actions
6. Tests are descriptive and follow a clear pattern
